## Sandstorm

This Sandstorm app uses docker to build it's package.

* You must have docker v1.1+ installed.
* First run `docker build -t tinytinyrss .` to build the docker image
* Then you will need to run the image with `docker run -p 33411:33411 --dns='127.0.0.1' -i -t tinytinyrss /sbin/my_init -- /bin/bash`
* Vist the app in your browser by going to http://localhost:33411 and follow the setup instructions. The mysql username is `mysql` and the password is `mysql`, and the database name should be `app`.
* Exit this image after it has booted up and run the app successfully. Then run `./export_docker.sh` from this directory to export the last run docker container into a folder named `dockerenv`.
* Once this is done, `spk dev` and `spk pack` should now work like normal

## Requirements

* Compatible web browser (http://tt-rss.org/wiki/CompatibleBrowsers)
* Web server, for example Apache
* PHP (with support for mbstring functions)
* PostgreSQL (tested on 8.3) or MySQL (InnoDB and version 4.1+ required)
